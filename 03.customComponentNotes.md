1. What is a React component?
A function that returns React element (react element -> objects that get created
when we return jsx (special syntax of React -> returning regular JS object, those 
objects are turned into real dom elements on the screen)).

2. Components need to be pascal case.

3. Call your component: Function components need to be surrounded by angle bracket < />
