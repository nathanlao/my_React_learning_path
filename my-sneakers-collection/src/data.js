Some of the half-finished characteristics of the sneaker include an OFF-WHITE zip tie on the collar, a Swoosh linked to the shoe with noticeable blue stitching, 'Air' printed on the midsole. The box is deconstructed as it is turned inward with the inside consisting of a black structure and a gold Jumpman logo, while the outside is plain cardboard with the words 'Jumpman' printed on it."

The leather upper appears primarily in University Blue, while the usual over-the-top branding emerges on the laces and medial side. A tonal sole unit includes the usual Air cushioning and concentric traction pattern."
