### Is it possible to pass states to a sibling component?
- NO!

### Prop drilling
- It happens when a component down the component tree needs access to data in a higher component, and the data is manually passed down to each child component until it reaches the component that needs it.

- Say if the sibling component needs the state as well? You need to pass it from a higher component thru props, then these component (in the same level of the tree) can get it.

### But what if there is a component that is completely disconnected needs the state?

- That is annoying because you might need to pass it from root component(App) down to the child component who needs it

### Solution???
- YES
- `Compound component`: 
    - flatten the structure
    - easily pass props to more deeply-nested components
- `Context`: access state directly from the components that need it
