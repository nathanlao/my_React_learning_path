### Is it possible to pass states to a sibling component?
- NO!

### Prop drilling
- It happens when a component down the component tree needs access to data in a higher component, and the data is manually passed down to each child component until it reaches the component that needs it.

- Say if the sibling component needs the state as well? You need to pass it from a higher component thru props, then these component (in the same level of the tree) can get it.

### But what if there is a component that is completely disconnected needs the state?

- That is annoying because you might need to pass it from root component(App) down to the child component who needs it

### Solution???
- YES
#### 1. Compound component
- flatten the structure
- easily pass props to more deeply-nested components

    `Compound component`:

        - Use `children` props
        - Each component can have dedicated function or styling
        - Make the component structure more transparent
        - Give more control to the "user" of the component

#### 2. Context
- access state directly from the components that need it

### But how to have components state to interact with each other or pass state from parent to children component?

#### 1. React.Children API
- An API provided by React, act as an utility that provides methods fro interacting with a component's `direct` children elements
        
    - React.Children.map()
    - React.Children.forEach()
    - React.cloneElement()
        - Utility that duplicates a React element and provides a way to inject additional props to that element.
        - When used with `React.Children.map()`, it can be used to augment the original children with new props
