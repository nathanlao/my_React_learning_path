### Hooks
- `Hooks` allow you "hook into" the rendering cycles of React
- e.g. `useState` maintains variables across render cycles, and change the state will trigger re-render of React components
- e.g. `useRef` maintains values across render cycles without causing re-renders

### Custom hooks
- Combine existing hooks into custom, reusable pieces of logic
- Similar to regular utility functions, but use hooks to access the render cycles of React
