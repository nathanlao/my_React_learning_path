## Compound Components

1. The concept of compound components in React?

        Components that work together to accomplish an objective


2. Examples of HTML elements that work together to add functionality or styling to each other?

        <ul> & <li>, <select> & <option>, <table> & all the other table eles

3. How compound components help to avoid having to drill props multiple levels down?

- State can be passed directly in the component that render `<select>` & `<option>`, no need to go the `<select>` first and then `<option>` thru props
            
            const state = {}
            <select>
                <option>
                <option>
                <option>
            </select>

- Compound component "flatten" the heirarchy. Since we need to provide the children (props.children in Meun.js) to render, the parent-most component (Menu) has direct access to those "grandchild" components (MenuButtion and MenuDropdown), to which it can pass whatever props it needs to pass directly.
