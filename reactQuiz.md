1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"`
React is what defines JSX.

2. If I were to console.log(staticPage) in index.js, what would show up?
JS objects. React elements that describe what React should eventually add to the 
real DOM for us.

3. We need JSX to be nested under a single parent element.

4. declarative? imperative?
`declarative`: Tell the program what to accomplish and expect it would know how to do step by step
`imperative`: Need to tell program HOW to do step by step

5. Composable?
`composable`: we have small pieces that we can put together to make sth larger/greater 
than individual pieces.
