### Nested Routes
1. When you want to keep displaying some UI on the page but also want to add more
2. When you want to avoid repetition in the route definitions

- Nested URL
    - /van
    - /van/van-id-or-name

- Shared UI
    - Often parts of the page are shared within the same route

### Questions:
1. Why using a nested route?
    - Whenever we have some `shared UI` among multiple different routes in our app


2. What is a "Layout Route"?
    - It's the `parent route` of some nested routes that contains the portion of the UI that will be shared
    - Will be useing `Outlet` component


3. What does the `<Outlet />` component do? When to use it?
    - `<Outlet />` component renders the `matching child route`'s `element` prop given in its route definition
    - Use it when we have a `parent Route (layout route)` that's wrapping `children routes`


4. What is an `Index Route`?
    - It's the `default route` we want to render when the path of the parent route matches. It gives us a chance to `render an element` inside the parent's `<Outlet />` at the `same path` as the `parent route`
