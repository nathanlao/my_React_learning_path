### Loaders for fetching data

- How does using loaders different from using useEffect to fetch data?
 - Because we are doing the data fetching `outside` of the code of the component, `react router` can `delay` the rendering of the the page until the `loader has finished its task` (data fetching)
 - ***Only after the fetch request has completed and the loader has gotten the data, then it will transfer us to the page***

1. Export a `loader` function from the page that fetches the data
2. Pass a `loader prop` to the Route that render that page and pass in the loader function
3. Use the `useLoaderData` hook in the component to get the data


### Questions?
1. When does the code in a loader function run?
    - Before the route change happens and the component for that route loads


2. What are some benefits of using a `data loader` function instead of fetching our data in a `useEffect` in a component?
   - No need to worry about handling `loading state`
   - No need to handle `error state`
   - No need to have lengthy useEffect code
   
   
3. What change need to make to `BrowserRouter` before using loaders (or any of the new data-layer API features) in our app?
    - https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/picking-a-router
    - Use `createBrowserRouter()` and `createRoutesFromElements()`
   
   
4. What are the steps take in order to use a loader on any given route?

    1. Define and export a loader function
    2. Import the loader and pass it to the route we want to fetch data for
    3. Use the `useLoaderData()` hook to get the data from the loader function
