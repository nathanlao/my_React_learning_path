1. How to change the route definitions in order to "protect" certain routes from an un-logged-in user?
   - `Wrapped the routes` we wanted to protect in a `Layout route` that contains logic to redirect someone if they're not logged in 
   
   
2. What component to use to automatically send someone
   to a different route in our app?
   - `<Navigate to=" "/>`


3. What component to render if the user IS logged in?
    - `<Outlet />`
