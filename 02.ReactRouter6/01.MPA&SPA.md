## Multi-page Application & Single-page Application
- **MPA**: Client requests a page from the server, and `new requests will be made again` every time the user navigates to a new page.
    - Client side need to ***load a new page*** that requested from the server

- **SPA**: Client requests a page from the server, server responds back with a whole React App pack. New requests could still be made to the server but server could only sends back some JSON data
    - Client side only need to ***load the part of the content*** of the page
